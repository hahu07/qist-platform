## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Platform downtime impacts trust
- **Mitigation**: Juno provides 99.9% uptime on ICP, redundant systems

### Regulatory Risks
- **Risk**: Waqf laws vary by country
- **Mitigation**: Start in favorable jurisdiction, partner with local institutions, legal counsel per market

### Shariah Risks
- **Risk**: Fatwas differ between scholars
- **Mitigation**: Establish credible Shariah board early, be conservative in interpretations, document all rulings

### Market Risks
- **Risk**: Insufficient investor demand
- **Mitigation**: Dual-pool strategy diversifies user base, start with smaller target markets, proven demand exists globally

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Business defaults hurt investor confidence
- **Mitigation**: Rigorous due diligence, diversification, transparent communication, maintain reserves
