## Platform Relationship

✅ **Investors are Indirect**: Investors have Mudarabah with platform, platform finances you  
✅ **Platform Manages**: Platform handles investor relations, you focus on business  
✅ **Transparency Required**: Regular reporting to platform and (through platform) to investors  
✅ **Contract Compliance**: Fulfill obligations per your specific Islamic contract type  

### Benefits of This Model
- Single relationship with platform (not multiple investors)
- Professional fund management
- Simplified communication
- Platform expertise in Islamic finance
- Platform handles legal and compliance complexity
