# QistFi Platform Documentation

**QistFi (قسط)** - Multi-Asset Ethical Investment Platform for Shariah-Compliant Financing

## Overview

QistFi is the world's first **hybrid Islamic crowdfunding platform** that combines profit-oriented investment with perpetual philanthropic endowments (Waqf). The platform provides interest-free, Shariah-compliant financing to businesses through two distinct capital pools:

1. **Profit Pool** - Investors seeking financial returns
2. **Waqf Pool** - Donors creating perpetual social impact endowments

## Platform Model

### Multi-Asset Structure

#### **Two Capital Pools**

**1. Profit Pool (Investment)**
- Platform ↔ Investor: Mudarabah (Profit-sharing partnership)
  - Platform acts as Mudarib (fund manager)
  - Investors act as Rabb al-Mal (capital providers)
  - Hybrid model: Directed investments + Pooled investments
  - Investors can withdraw capital
  - Returns distributed to investors

**2. Waqf Pool (Philanthropic Endowment)**
- Platform ↔ Donor: Waqf Management (Mutawalli)
  - Platform manages Waqf capital as Mutawalli (trustee)
  - Donors endow capital perpetually (Waqif)
  - Capital never withdrawn (endowed forever)
  - Returns distributed to charitable beneficiaries
  - Social impact focus

#### **Unified Business Financing**

Both pools finance businesses using flexible Islamic contracts:
- Musharakah (Joint venture)
- Murabaha (Cost-plus financing)
- Ijarah (Leasing)
- Salam (Forward sale)
- Istisna'a (Manufacturing contract)

**Business Types**:
- **Profit Pool** → Growth-oriented, profit-maximizing businesses
- **Waqf Pool** → Social enterprises, impact-first businesses
