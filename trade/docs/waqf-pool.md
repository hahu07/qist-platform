# Waqf Endowment Pool

## Overview

The Waqf Pool is QistFi's philanthropic financing arm, enabling donors to create perpetual endowments (Waqf) that generate ongoing social impact. Unlike the Profit Pool where investors seek financial returns, Waqf contributors donate capital that remains endowed forever, with investment returns directed to charitable causes and social impact businesses.

---

## Core Principles

### What is Waqf?
**Waqf** (وقف) is an Islamic endowment - a perpetual charitable donation where:
- **Principal remains intact** forever (cannot be withdrawn)
- **Only investment returns** are used for charitable purposes
- **Donor receives eternal reward** (sadaqah jariyah - ongoing charity)
- **Benefits continue** across generations

### Platform's Role
- **Mutawalli (Waqf Manager)**: Platform manages Waqf capital responsibly
- **Invests in social impact businesses** using Shariah-compliant instruments
- **Distributes returns** to specified beneficiaries
- **Reports transparently** on impact created
- **Preserves principal** for perpetuity
